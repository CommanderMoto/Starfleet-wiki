It's a simple fact that, when you're fighting for your life, that fight becomes your all-consuming raison d'Ãªtre.

It's the reason why homeless people are so frequently associated with criminal activity. If you're fighting for your life, you're not in a good place to think about the needs of those around you - more likely, you're just angry that you're struggling while they look like they're not. 

====== Housing Co-Ops ======
[[https://www.squareonevillages.org/housing-co-op|SquareOne Villages]] is a nonprofit developer of permanently affordable housing co-ops in Lane County, Oregon. 

[[https://communitysupportedshelters.org/|Community Supported Shelters]] is another group we are presently researching.

From [[headquarters|Starfleet Headquarters]], we intend to partner with and serve as a promotional resource for the various housing co-operatives in the area, for those who meet the criteria for this form of housing but don't know where to start.

====== Hexayurts ======
Originally developed by [[https://g.co/kgs/b9TLSi|Vinay Gupta]], the [[http://hexayurt.com/|hexayurt]] design meets humans' needs for shelter with a budget-friendly bill of materials.

Burning Man has demonstrated that the hexayurt design is excellent shelter in the desert environment, and in fact has served as an effective promotional tool for the design. We believe that with a small investment in research and development, we can come up with a standardized design that is suited to the rainforest climate of Eugene.

Starfleet will stockpile hexayurt construction materials at our headquarters. We will teach classes in hexayurt construction, and sell materials to two primary markets:
  - To people who already have the privilege of a private roof with attached mailing address, we will offer our construction materials and classes on a for-profit basis. This activity will subsidize our outreach efforts in the community.
  - To people who do not currently have shelter of their own:
    - Classes in hexayurt construction will be offered for free
    - Materials we have obtained via bulk discounts will be distributed at cost.
