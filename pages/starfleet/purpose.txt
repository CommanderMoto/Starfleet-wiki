===== Why Starfleet? =====
If you look at it from a distance and squint your eyes just so, you might notice that Starfleet is hoping to serve the community in a similar fashion to how traditional churches and other charitable foundations have for time immemorial.

But times change, and "religion" - at least in the form that my father taught me - has been a decaying tradition.

Many of us in the LGBTQIA+ community do not feel comfortable with The Church for one reason or another, but so far, we all seem to agree that Starfleet - that is, the extremely well-documented fictional entity - seems to be aligned with our values.

A significant difference between Starfleet and "The Church" is that, while both are focused on the betterment of all humankind, we will also generate our own revenue - and successful entrepreneurs - via the companies that we incubate within our program.

Furthermore, much like a church, we hope to give the people who we help a reason to buy into our mission. That's what [[:academy|Starfleet Academy]] is there for.
