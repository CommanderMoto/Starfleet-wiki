===== Why Starfleet? =====
Progressive action is a wonderful thing. Each little thing individuals do to make a difference in their community, it matters.

Coordinated action is the most powerful thing we humans have discovered. It's the resonance that Nikolas Tesla harnessed to such impressive effect in his coils; it's the difference between the light of a campfire compared against the coherent light emitted by a laser.

See, a campfire keeps you warm and illuminates the immediate area. Campfires are great, we all love campfires. But the radius they can affect is limited.

A laser beam is a just bunch of photons which are all going in the same direction, in lockstep with one another, and we've seen  how just a few watts of energy can form a beam that endures all the way to the moon and back. 

A campfire emits thousands of watts of energy, tens of thousands even. But you can't light up the moon with a campfire.

Starfleet is the resonant chamber, the laser cavity, which will help align all our individual progressive actions into a Force to be Reckoned With.
