===== Starfleet is a Benefit Corporation =====
Starfleet (BC) was founded on the twenty-first day of the twenty-first year of the twenty-first century, and conceived as a decoupling layer between late-stage capitalism and progressive social experimentation. 

The "elevator pitch" is this: we hold a set of values that we believe are broadly shared within the community. As a step towards restoring some sense of unity, we want to offer people the opportunity to make a positive statement about their values. Joining and maintaining a membership in good standing with Starfleet will convey additional privileges when dealing with Starfleet-associated entities.

In short, we're selling an ethos: if you are Starfleet material, you get the endorsement of Starfleet; consumers who want to support the causes that Starfleet supports can do so by looking for the Starfleet seal of approval.

Furthermore, through [[starfleet:academy|Starfleet Academy]] we hope to serve as an educational resource to the community - providing a space and supportive resources for people who have something to teach, with priority access given to classes which best embody the values that Starfleet represents.

Now, an ethos like this doesn't do much unless there are mechanisms to support it. [[identity|Starfleet ID]] is intended as a mechanism to provide accountability for our members, in word and deed. The [[rank|Starfleet Rank System]] is the mechanism by which we recognize achievement (or ignominy), and the [[credit|Starfleet Credit]] is a unit of barter currency which we believe could help move our economic agenda forward even more effectively.

Ultimately, Starfleet's ambition is to become a quasi-governmental entity, complete with land holdings, assets, and a population of compassionate activists who are engaged in making positive changes in the world.
