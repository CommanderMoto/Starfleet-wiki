==== Why? ====
=== Because this community cares about progress ===
On a national level, the political parties in the United States - and more generally, groups of people in power worldwide - have not served the interests of 95%+ of the global population in decades. And the further we proceed in this late-stage capitalist game, the more evident are the inequities that were baked into our political and economic systems. These inequities have been magnified and exacerbated at every opportunity by the strong (them that have the gold) against the weak (them that don't).

We're sick of it, and we've been trying to do things to make it better. We've been organizing to make the changes we want to see happen on a local level, and Starfleet is coming online with the intention of coordinating all those individual actions into a laser-focused beam of forward progress that will have the power to effect change far beyond the boundaries of our little town.

=== Because this community's genderqueer / differently-abled population needs a place to live and work. ===
Yes, this is inspired by one person's struggle, but it's a struggle we see affecting so many others as well. 

//Others who haven't attained the same level of privilege that we have.//

We note that we are surrounded by a loving community of people ready to see some change in the world, and we want to be a big part of that change.
