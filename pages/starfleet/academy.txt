====== Starfleet Academy ======
===== Purpose =====
Starfleet Academy will be formed as a mechanism for inducting new recruits into the Starfleet structure, clarifying community norms and expectations, with “Crew” status awarded upon successful graduation.

===== Lessons =====
Empathy is not uncommon, but employing it effectively in our day to day lives, to improve the well-being of ourselves and those around us? It is Starfleet's position that some skills training will be needed to ensure all our members share a common background.
