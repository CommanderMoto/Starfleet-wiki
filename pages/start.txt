====== What Is Starfleet? ======
==== Starfleet is a Benefit Corporation ====
Conceived as a decoupling layer between late-stage capitalism and progressive social experimentation. 

Phase one is focused on securing facilities for our headquarters, which in the short term will also serve as a live / work home for queer entrepreneurs.

=== A space for serving the community ===
It's a haven where trans people will be able to collaborate with other trans people. To organize into effective action, to promote the healing and social change we see such need for today.

== Hair Removal ==
You don't have to consider yourself low-income to look at prices for permanent hair removal and let off an impressed "whew!" - and this is an essential need for about half the trans people out there. And it's a procedure that's only rarely covered by health insurance.

**[[co-op|We can do this together.]]** Electrolysis and laser, we have people who can teach and people eager to learn. All we need is some support in securing the equipment; we are motivated to take care of one another!

We hope that by increasing the supply of well-trained hair removal professionals, in time we can help solve "the hair problem" for the broader community as well.

== Partnership with White Bird Clinic? ==
TBD


====== Why? ======
==== Because this community's genderqueer / differently-abled population needs a place to live and work. ====
Yes, this is inspired by one person's struggle, but it's a struggle they see affecting many others. Others with even less privilege. And we see that we are surrounded by a loving community of people ready to see some change in the world, and we want to help be that change.

==== Because this community is proud of the progress we're making ====

== We Envision ==
this becoming a nest of support for trans people in Eugene.

== We Aspire ==
to provide innovative and comprehensive support to our trans and differently-abled communities - starting in Eugene, Oregon, and eventually reaching worldwide!

== We Address ==
A major quality-of-life issue - a need that many in the trans community would never be able to afford otherwise.
