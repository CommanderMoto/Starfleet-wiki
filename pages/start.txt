====== What Is Starfleet? ======
==== Starfleet is a Benefit Corporation ====
Conceived as a decoupling layer between late-stage capitalism and progressive social experimentation. 

Phase one is focused on securing facilities for our headquarters, which in the short term will also serve as a live / work home for queer entrepreneurs.

=== A space for serving the community ===
It's a haven where trans trains trans to get through some of the challenging and expensive parts in transition. 

== Hair Removal ==
**[[co-op|We can do this together.]]** Electrolysis and laser, we have people who can teach and people eager to learn. All we need is some support in securing the equipment; we are motivated to take care of one another!

The trainees can then go on to take those marketable skills into the community.

== Partnership with White Bird Clinic? ==
TBD


====== Why? ======
==== Because this community's genderqueer / differently-abled population needs a place to live and work. ====
Yes, this is inspired by one person's struggle, but it's a struggle they see affecting many others. Others with even less privilege. Who are surrounded by a loving community of people ready to see some change in the world.

==== Because this community is proud of the progress we're making ====
... and [[https://www.point2homes.com/US/Commercial-For-Sale/OR/Eugene/Whiteaker-Community/692-JEFFERSON-ST/100741035.html|this location]] is a great place to showcase that progress.
