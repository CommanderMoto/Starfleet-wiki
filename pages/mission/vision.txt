=== We Envision ===
  * This little seed of change, planted in a space where so much change is needed, will blossom into enormous improvements in the quality of life for the neighborhood, then the city, county, state, nation and planet. And when we have more than one planet to call home, we intend to make sure they're taken care of as well.
  * We care deeply about equity, and we believe that **all** people deserve to be treated with a basic level of respect and dignity. 
  * We are here to "raise the bar" for other entities who have repeatedly demonstrated that treating //all people// with what's so often called "simple human decency" is not as (privately) profitable as other alternatives.
