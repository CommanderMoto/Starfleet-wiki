== We Envision ==
  * This little seed of change, planted in a space where so much change is needed, will blossom into enormous improvements in the quality of life for our neighborhood. 
  * We care deeply about equity, and we believe that **all** people deserve to be treated with a basic level of respect and dignity. 
  * We are here to "raise the bar" for other entities who have repeatedly demonstrated that treating //all people// with what's so often called "simple human decency" is not as (privately) profitable as other alternatives.

== We Aspire ==
  * To provide innovative and comprehensive support to our community, starting with the trans and differently-abled population.
