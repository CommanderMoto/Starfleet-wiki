=== We Envision ===
  * Starfleet is a clearinghouse for coordinated progressive action - making lives better for people in our immediate community, acting in concert with others around the globe who are doing the same.
    * We will connect individuals who "just want to help somehow" with organizations who need their help
    * We will connect sources of funding with organizations in need.
  * Starfleet is an alliance of non-profit and for-profit businesses who have agreed to conduct their business in a way that conforms to our values.
  * Similar to an "Angi's List" resource, Starfleet will endorse certain for-profit companies based on "Starfleet Values," 
  * We care deeply about equity, and we believe that **all** people deserve to be treated with a basic level of respect and dignity. 
  * We are here to "raise the bar" for other entities who have repeatedly demonstrated that treating //all people// with what's so often called "simple human decency" is not as (privately) profitable as other alternatives.
