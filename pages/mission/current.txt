  * [[hairremoval|A major quality-of-life issue]] - a need that many in the trans community would never be able to afford otherwise. If you're not familiar with the topic, permanent hair removal is a lengthy and expensive "project." If a person in transition is unfortunate enough to lose their income while working on one of these "projects" - the results are not pretty. 
  * In light of this fact, losing a job can affect a trans person's self-esteem //particularly// harshly, leading to a whole host of negative follow-on effects.
