John Michael "Moto" Ashmore (They/them preferred - but "he/his" or "she/her" are also perfectly acceptable) is the person who's decided to take this thing from the world of fiction and bring it into our lives as unharmed as possible.

About the self-assigned rank: 
<html><blockquote>
I served in the United States Air Force from 1995-1999, and I recognize the value of the military chain of command. From what I have inferred about Starfleet (the fictional organization), I believe that my current mission is comparable in sophistication to that which would be undertaken by a person with a rank between "Lieutenant Commander" and "Captain." 
Since I'm the only person here right now, I guess that makes me Commander.

Progressive action is a wonderful thing. Each little thing individuals do to make a difference in their community, it matters.

Coordinated action is the most powerful thing we humans have discovered. It's the resonance that Nikolas Tesla harnessed to such impressive effect in his coils; it's the difference between the light of a campfire compared against the coherent light emitted by a laser.

Starfleet is the resonant chamber that will turn progressive actions into a Force To Be Reckoned With.

If you would like to reach Moto, their mobile is 541-390-0356 and their current email address is none of Starfleet's business. Once we have the mail servers online, we'll fix that.

No, Moto is not a member of the official Star Trek Fan Club, so if there are fandom rules that I have crossed, it's on you to tell me.
