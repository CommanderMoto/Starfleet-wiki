We're more than just our gender identities. Trans people need good jobs too.

We have innovators among our ranks already. Makers, designers, visionaries - all we need is to offer a space where they can do what they already love. But live / work arrangements, so well suited to innovation, are not so well suited to suburbs. Proximity to commercial areas is essential for the busy maker, both for supply runs and for marketing of finished products. And the noises of industry running well into the wee hours, while tolerable (even musical!) to the maker's ears, are not so much so for sleeping schoolchildren.
