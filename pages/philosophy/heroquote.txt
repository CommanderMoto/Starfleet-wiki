[[user:moto|Commander JM "Moto" Ashmore]] put it this way:
<html><blockquote>
Starfleet, as a concept, has always carried the ideals that I hold closest to my heart. It expresses my core values in a single, easily explained reference.<br/>
Like, no matter what the situation, I can always ask myself “what would a Starfleet officer do here?” - and that’s equivalent to my guiding light towards The Right Thing. <br/>
My heart gets all wibbly when I say stuff like that. That’s how I know it’s right.
