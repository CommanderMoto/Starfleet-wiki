Starfleet Commander JM "Moto" Ashmore put it this way:
  Starfleet, as a concept, has always carried the ideals that I hold closest to my heart.
  It expresses my core values in a single, easily explained reference.
  Like, no matter what the situation, I can always ask myself “what would a Starfleet officer do here?” 
  And that’s equivalent to my guiding light of the Right Thing.
  My heart gets all wibbly when I say stuff like that. 
  That’s how I know it’s right.
