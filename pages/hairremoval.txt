====== Project Bare Bear ======
== Hair Removal ==
You don't have to consider yourself low-income to look at prices for permanent hair removal and let off an impressed "whew!" - and this is an essential need for about half the trans people out there. And it's a procedure that's only rarely covered by health insurance.

**We can do this together.** Electrolysis and laser, we have people who can teach and people eager to learn. All we need is some support in securing the space and the equipment; we are motivated to take care of one another!

We hope that by increasing the supply of well-trained hair removal professionals, in time we can help make solutions to "the hair problem" more accessible to the broader community as well.

== Partnership with White Bird Clinic? ==
TBD
