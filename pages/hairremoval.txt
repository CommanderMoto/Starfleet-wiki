====== Project Bare Bear ======
=== Our Plan ===
  * We want to start by addressing [[:hairremoval|permanent hair removal]] - a need that many in the trans community would never be able to afford otherwise. 
    * If you're not familiar with the topic, permanent hair removal (no matter what method is used) is a lengthy and expensive "project." If a person in transition is unfortunate enough to lose their income while working on one of these "projects" - the results are not pretty. 
    * In light of this fact, losing a job can affect a trans person's self-esteem //particularly// harshly, leading to a whole host of negative follow-on effects.

== Hair Removal ==
You don't have to consider yourself low-income to look at prices for permanent hair removal and let off an impressed "whew!" - and this is an essential need for about half the trans people out there. And it's a procedure that's only rarely covered by health insurance.

**We can do this together.** Electrolysis and laser, we have people who can teach and people eager to learn. All we need is some support in securing the space and the equipment; we are motivated to take care of one another!

We hope that by increasing the supply of well-trained hair removal professionals, in time we can help make solutions to "the hair problem" more accessible to the broader community as well.

== Partnership with White Bird Clinic? ==
TBD
