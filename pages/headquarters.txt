==== Starfleet Headquarters ====
The entertainment fans might be upset that we're not starting in San Francisco. We had to push north a bit to find a community that really fit with our values. The community Eugene has already developed - many of us here started out as Bay Area refugees - makes this area ripe for progressive action.
 
=== A space for serving the community ===
It starts with a haven where Starfleet people will be able to collaborate with other Starfleet people. To organize into effective action, to promote the healing and social change we see such need for today.

Starfleet HQ will become a well-known meeting space for social change in the town of Eugene. We plan to begin making presentations to the community on the benefits of [[https://www.squareonevillages.org/presentations|the village model]] just as soon as people return to meeting one another in physical spaces.

Although if there's space for them to live at Campbell Club or Lorax Manner, [[user:moto|Moto]] would totally love to use that as a stepping-stone.
